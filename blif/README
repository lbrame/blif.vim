This plugin seeks to provide syntax highlighting for the BLIF (Berkeley Logic Interchange Format) for vim and neovim text editors.

The BLIF language has been created at the University of California, Berkeley. This is a student-made plugin made from a student at the University of Verona, Italy.

The BLIF language is commonly used in conjunction with the CAD program sis (https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1992/2010.html) and other derivates of it.
